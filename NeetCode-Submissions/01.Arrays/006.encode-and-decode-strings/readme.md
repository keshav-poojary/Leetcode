# Encode and Decode Strings

## Category
- Arrays

## Problem Summary
Given an array of strings arr[], implement an algorithm in the encode() function that can convert the given strings into a single encoded string, which can be transmitted over the network and then decoded back into the original array of strings from the encoded string. The decoding will happen in the decode() function. The encoding rule used here is: Each string is stored as length + "/:" + actual string.

## Approach
Use array scanning and counting patterns, keeping track of state while minimizing redundant passes.

## Solution Trace
1. Analyze the input and identify the key invariant or constraint the solution must maintain.
2. Transform the problem into a compact state representation that makes the decision easy to evaluate.
3. Apply the selected algorithm and update the answer as the scan progresses.
4. Validate the result against special cases such as empty input, duplicates, boundaries, and single-element cases.

## Code Trace
1. `If the value is new, it is inserted into the tracking structure so it can be compared later in the scan.`
2. `The main loop walks through the input one element at a time and applies the decision logic to every position.`

## Code Walkthrough
- If the value is new, it is inserted into the tracking structure so it can be compared later in the scan.
- The main loop walks through the input one element at a time and applies the decision logic to every position.

    A[Read input] --> B[Track seen state]
    B --> C{Value already seen?}
    C -- Yes --> D[Return true]
    C -- No --> E[Insert value]
    E --> F[Continue scan]
    F --> G{End of array?}
    G -- No --> B
    G -- Yes --> H[Return false]
```

## Algorithm
1. Read the problem constraints and identify the correct state to track.
2. Choose the most fitting pattern for the data structure involved.
3. Process the collection or graph in a single pass where possible.
4. Maintain the answer and verify correctness against edge cases.
5. Return the final value or structure after the traversal is complete.

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n) or O(n log n), depending on the exact operation pattern used in the solution.
- Space Complexity: O(n) or O(1) auxiliary space, based on the chosen data structure and recursion/stack usage.

## Core Intuition
The solution reduces the problem to a smaller, trackable state and then uses the correct structural pattern to process the input efficiently. This keeps the implementation both easy to follow and correct for the constraints.

## Edge Cases
- Empty input or single-element input
- Duplicate values or repeated edges
- Boundary values and extreme indices
- Already-sorted or reverse-sorted scenarios
- Cycles, null nodes, or disconnected components when relevant

# Combination Sum

## Category
- Backtracking

## Problem Summary
Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order. The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different. The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.

## Approach
Explore candidate choices recursively and backtrack once a branch is invalid or complete.

## Solution Trace
1. Analyze the input and identify the key invariant or constraint the solution must maintain.
2. Transform the problem into a compact state representation that makes the decision easy to evaluate.
3. Apply the selected algorithm and update the answer as the scan progresses.
4. Validate the result against special cases such as empty input, duplicates, boundaries, and single-element cases.

## Code Trace
1. `If the value is new, it is inserted into the tracking structure so it can be compared later in the scan.`
2. `The main loop walks through the input one element at a time and applies the decision logic to every position.`
3. `The stack or deque preserves the order of pending work so the algorithm can revisit states in the correct sequence.`

## Code Walkthrough
- If the value is new, it is inserted into the tracking structure so it can be compared later in the scan.
- The main loop walks through the input one element at a time and applies the decision logic to every position.
- The stack or deque preserves the order of pending work so the algorithm can revisit states in the correct sequence.

```

## Algorithm
1. Read the problem constraints and identify the correct state to track.
2. Choose the most fitting pattern for the data structure involved.
3. Process the collection or graph in a single pass where possible.
4. Maintain the answer and verify correctness against edge cases.
5. Return the final value or structure after the traversal is complete.

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n) or O(n log n), depending on the exact operation pattern used in the solution.
- Space Complexity: O(n) or O(1) auxiliary space, based on the chosen data structure and recursion/stack usage.

## Core Intuition
The solution reduces the problem to a smaller, trackable state and then uses the correct structural pattern to process the input efficiently. This keeps the implementation both easy to follow and correct for the constraints.

## Edge Cases
- Empty input or single-element input
- Duplicate values or repeated edges
- Boundary values and extreme indices
- Already-sorted or reverse-sorted scenarios
- Cycles, null nodes, or disconnected components when relevant
